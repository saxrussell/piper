# Basic string stuff

# first, define a variable that contains a string value
greeting_string = "Greetings from your local Python interpreter!"

'''
now that our string is in memory, do something with it. calling the print() function on it will write the string 
to the operating system's standard output (a.k.a. "stdout") channel...usually the terminal windows where the 
python program was executed.

print(greeting_string)
